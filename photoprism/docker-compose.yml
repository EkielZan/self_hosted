# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Linux / AMD64)
#
# Note:
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), for example, when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:
#   https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/proxies/traefik/

# CLI Commands:
# - https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/#command-line-interface

# All commands may have to be prefixed with "sudo" when not running as root.
# This will point the home directory shortcut ~ to /root in volume mounts.

    ## Don't enable automatic restarts until PhotoPrism has been properly configured and tested!
    ## If the service gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory, filesystem, network, or database issue:

    ## Share hardware devices with FFmpeg and TensorFlow (optional):

    ## Storage Folders: "~" is a shortcut for your home directory, "." for the current directory
    volumes:

      # - "~/Pictures:/photoprism/originals"               # Original media files (DO NOT REMOVE)
      - "/mnt/4tb/photoprism/originals:/photoprism/originals"               # Original media files (DO NOT REMOVE)
      # - "/example/family:/photoprism/originals/family" # *Additional* media folders can be mounted like this
      - "/mnt/4tb/winshare/images:/photoprism/import"                  # *Optional* base folder from which files can be imported to originals
      - "/mnt/4tb/photoprism/storage:/photoprism/storage"                  # *Writable* storage folder for cache, database, and sidecar files (DO NOT REMOVE)

  ## Database Server (recommended)
  ## see https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#should-i-use-sqlite-mariadb-or-mysql
  mariadb:
    image: mariadb:10.11
    ## If MariaDB gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory or filesystem issue:
